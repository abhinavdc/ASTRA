# ASTRA
ASTRA, A fully integrated workflow management system for government offices with built in queuing and complaint registration system.  Whenever a user needs a specific service, he requests it through the ASTRA online portal. Portal has the option to upload the documents and mention the necessary details about the service requested. Whenever a user submits a new request it is automatically assigned a position in a virtual queue, and is randomly assigned to an employee who is designated to handle such type of requests in the respective department. Unlike conventional way of depending one single person for services ASTRA allows us to distribute the workload among the employees who can provide that service, based on their organizational hierarchy.  The system will increase efficiency and make sure that each and every officer in the department is having the similar workload. Each request on the queue is fixed a deadline based on Right to Service Act. If an official fails to provide the service within the deadline, a complaint is automatically sent to the higher authorities, he will have to give a report about the cause of the delay. Every development happening on the requests are notified to users by SMS. By implementing ASTRA, we can effectively monitor the efficiency and analyze the performance of the government officials.
